#This solution has two projects, one for the actual ASP.Net Core Application built using a Model-Controller-View (MVC) approach to the solution. the other is the testing created whilst using TDD practices, testing each scenario as required, modifying the conditions as the requirements overlapped.

#The project is ready to be expanded upon, mainly using a database connection to populate stuff like expiration dates of products and add more rules in. The Expiration date has a default value in currently, but this can be easily over-written by the database and the model has a method with a datetime in the utilise as soon as. There are tests written to test each scenario

#The test automation framework uses the Visual Studio testing packages currently, which allows easy running through the IDE and then can be easily added to the build from the project dependencies. If there are any issues with the dependencies when loaidng this project, remove the project dependencies and re-add the ASP.NET Core project back into the testing project
